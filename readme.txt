== Description ==

Turn your multi-site installation of WordPress into many multi-site networks, all surrounding one central user base.

WP Multi Network allows cape wearing super admins to create new network collections of sites, allowing for infinitely extensible site, network, and domain arrangements.

== Installation ==

You can download and install WP Multi Network using the built in WordPress plugin installer. If you download WP Multi Network manually, make sure it is uploaded to "/wp-content/plugins/wp-multi-network.php".

Activate in the "Plugins" admin panel using the "Activate" link.

Start planning and creating your networks!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I have separate domains? =

Yes you can. That is what this plugin does best!

= Will this work on standard WordPress? =

Yes! But it won't do anything! You will need to have the multi-site functionality turned on and working before using this WP Multi Network.

= Where can I get support? =

I am most likely to be found on the BuddyPress support forums website: http://buddypress.org/forums/

= Where can I find documentation? =

Not much to talk about really. Check the code for details!
